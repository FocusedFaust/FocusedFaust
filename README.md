**Hey there stranger**, I'm Faust :) 🫶

I'm currently a student at EPFL in Computer Science, which doesn't stop me from starting a new side-project every week.

**📝 Currently**, I'm working on:
- Passing my semester (yes mom)
- Re-creating the swiss CFF app for my CS-108 class
- Compiling notes by each semesters: [LectureNotes](https://github.com/FocusedFaust/LectureNotes)
- Coding the [Bubble Cheker](https://github.com/FocusedFaust/BubbleChecker) with the wonderful [@Maërwan](https://github.com/hotwraith)
- and many other offline projects 😊 *//TODO: continue my crochet blanket*
